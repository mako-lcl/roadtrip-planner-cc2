Plan a roadtrip from Kassel to Medebach from August 1st to August 5th on foot. The roadtrip should contain a packing list, a list of locations with their name, latitude and longitude on the trip with possible activities as a list of names. Reduce the number of stops to a maximum of 10. Give the response as a json and include the start and end location names as start_location and end_location. Include if the trip is possible in the json with the name is_possible. Also include the start and end date in the response as start_date and end_date. Use packing_list as the field name for the packing list and locations as the field name for the list of locations.
